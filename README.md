# Antenna Array Pattern Synthesis and Beamforming Verification

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code, simulation data, and documentation for my Senior Design Project at **Hacettepe University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering**.

The core objective of this project is to solve the inverse electromagnetic problem of antenna arrays: deriving the necessary **complex excitation weight matrix** to generate a specific, pre-defined radiation pattern (beam profile) provided by the supervisor.

## Key Features
* **Pattern Synthesis:** Calculation of amplitude and phase coefficients (weight matrix) to match a desired beam pattern.
* **Algorithm Implementation:** Utilization of **[Algorithm Name, e.g., LMS / Genetic Algorithm / Convex Optimization]** to minimize the error between the desired and synthesized patterns.
* **Simulation & Verification:** Validation of the calculated weights using **MATLAB** and **[Simulation Tool, e.g., HFSS / CST]**.
* **Hardware Implementation:** Applying the derived weight matrix to a physical **[Antenna Type, e.g., Phased Array]** system to verify the actual radiation pattern in a real-world environment.

## Workflow
1.  **Input:** Receive the desired beam pattern (Target Radiation Pattern).
2.  **Processing:** Compute the optimal Weight Matrix ($W$) corresponding to the target pattern.
3.  **Output:** Export complex weights (Magnitude & Phase) for the antenna feed network.
4.  **Testing:** Measure the actual beam profile generated by the antenna array and compare it with the simulation.
